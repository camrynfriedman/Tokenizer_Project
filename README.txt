Files included:
tokenizer.py - the implementation of the tokenizer class
data/prog1_correct.txt - a sample input for the tokenizer
data/prog2_correct.txt - another sample input for the tokenizer
data/prog3_correct.txt - another sample input
data/prog1_expectedOutput.txt - expected output when running program with prog1_correct.txt input
data/prog2_expectedOutput.txt - expected output when running program with prog2_correct.txt input
data/prog3_expectedOutput.txt - expected output when running program with prog3_correct.txt input
documentation.txt - information about the program, testing methodology, and future improvements based on current bugs
README.txt - files included in submission, how to compile and execute

How to compile and execute program:
In order to compile and execute the program, you must navigate to the directory of the program.
Then, type "python tokenizer.py xx" where python can be "python" or "python3", depending on your version, and xx is the input file. 
For me, the input files are all stored as plaintext files in the data folder. 
So, for example, if I wanted to execute the program with "prog1_correct.txt", I would type into the terminal: "python3 tokenizer.py data/prog1_correct.txt"
